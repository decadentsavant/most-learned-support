                <h3>About the Developer</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm Corey, an amateur app developer who built Most Learned in my spare time. This app improved my life, and now I'm sharing it with the world. The app is 100% free with no ads, subscriptions, or data selling - I'm footing the bill out of my own pocket while working at a non-profit.</p>
                
                <p>My goal is simple: help people brainwash themselves with good vibes, purpose, and action. Here's to leveling up, one recurring thought at a time! üöÄüìñ</p>
